\section{Thesis Problems}

\textbf{Biology PhD Thesis}: Furthering our understanding of Ca$^{2+}$ spikes. (1) Discriminating neuronal Ca$^{2+}$ spikes in an EEG signal using Machine Learning. (2) Determining the contribution, if any, of glial Ca$^{2+}$ waves on an EEG or ECoG signals. One can begin by using GCaMP in tandem with ECoG recordings. 

\textbf{Applied Math PhD Thesis}: Computational modeling of a neuron's filtering ability. Begin with conduction-based models and work toward a reduced dynamical system (i.e., one which combines neuronal morphology in to a single variable). Seek out an LFP Power Law. Show that it maybe be applied to current systems. 

\textbf{Nobel Prize in Physics}: Solve the Navier-Stokes equations.
