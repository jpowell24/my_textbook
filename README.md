# Brain-spine-muscle interface textbook
If a textbook doesn't exist for the subject you want to learn about, write yourself one. 

To my knowledge, there is no collection of information that one would need to build a BSMI. As this is something I want to do, I resolved to make my own. This is made for me to reference later, as I learn and grow. Thus, the phrasing, organization, side-comments (excessively so), etc. are optimized to myself---and may not be a good fit for most. 

With regard to citations, I am primarily citing only when I find something particularly interesting, or worthy of reading a bit more about in the future. Otherwise, citations will be sparse (but  the general ideas are usually drawn from sources mentioned at the beginning of a section). 

I hope that as I continue to build and add to this, in 10 years it will be worth someone's while to read.
