# Brain-spine-muscle interface textbook
If a textbook doesn't exist for the subject you want to learn about, write yourself one. 

To my knowledge, there is no collection of information that one would need to build a BSMI. As this is something I want to do, I resolved to make my own. This is made for me to reference later, as I learn and grow. Thus, the phrasing, organization, side-comments, etc. are optimized to myself---and may not be a good fit for most.
