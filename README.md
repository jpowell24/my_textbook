Note: My plan for the semester is to update approx. once per week. Since a few of my courses are relevant, and with the background reading I do, it seems most convenient to synthesize everything at the end of the week into this book. Therefore, you can expect a couple extra pages every Sat / Sun or so. 

# Brain-spine-muscle interface textbook
If a textbook doesn't exist for the subject you want to learn about, write yourself one!

This is made for me to reference later, as I learn and grow. Thus, the phrasing, organization, side-comments (excessively so), etc. are optimized to myself---and may not be a good fit for most. To my knowledge, there is no collection of information that one would need to build a BSMI. As this is something I want to do, it will be useful to collect all of this information in one place. 

With regard to citations, I am primarily citing only when I find something particularly interesting, or worthy of reading a bit more about in the future. Otherwise, citations will be sparse (but  the general ideas are usually drawn from sources mentioned at the beginning of a section). 

I hope that as I continue to build and add to this, in 10 years it will be worth someone's while to read.
